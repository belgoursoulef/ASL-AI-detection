# Sign Language Recognition AI

This project is a **real-time Sign Language (ASL) recognition system** using **Mediapipe** for hand landmark detection and **TensorFlow** for machine learning.
The model has been converted to **TensorFlow.js** so it can run directly in a web browser with live webcam input.

## **Features**

- Collect hand sign data for ASL letters
- Train a neural network model to recognize signs
- Live prediction from webcam
- Can be hosted online using **GitHub Pages** with TensorFlow.js
- Uses lightweight landmark-based AI for fast, real-time performance
